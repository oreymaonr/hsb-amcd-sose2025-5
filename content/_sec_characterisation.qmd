# Characterisation

The small signal ac analysis and transcient analysis for ideal, theoretical and practical scenario is plotted here.

The plots are made in python with the help of `matplotlib` package of python. 

## Small signal ac analysis

### ideal circuit

```{python}

import plotfn as fn

fn.generatePlots()
```
### real circuit

### practical circuit

## Transcient Analysis

```{python}
import plotfn as fn

filename = r"C:\Users\91854\Documents\Study Materials\summer25\amcd-shared-repo\Red Pithaya images\Red Pithaya images\HPF_T_500.csv"
title = "something"
fn.transCientAnalysisPlot(title,filename,[0,1,2])

```
