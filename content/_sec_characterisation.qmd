# PCB Design using KiCAD


From the above @fig-kicadschematics , we get can generate a PCB Layout. Care is taken to avoid signal interference. The track width is chosen to be 0.025 inches or 0.635 mm. The number of via's and 90 degree tracks are reduced and avoided.

## PCB 2D Layout

Most of the SMD(Surface Mount Devices) are chosen with 0805 variants. For the op-amp, the spice model, 3D model and footprint is downloaded from official [ti website](https://www.ti.com/product/TL082#design-tools-simulation). The DRC check and zone filling of voltages in PCB is also done.

## PCB 3D Rendered View

The 3D model of all devices including the op-amp is loaded from the official websites and hence rendered. The final view is cross verified.

# Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the complete design and implementation of a universal biquad filter across behavioral modeling, simulation, ASLK PRO, and PCB levels. High-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filter configurations were realized with results that closely aligned with expected theoretical characteristics. These outcomes validate the robustness of the design methodology and the effectiveness of the development workflow.

While the band-stop filter (BSF) at the PCB level did not yield optimal performance, likely due to signal noise or interference in the layout, this isolated issue does not overshadow the overall success of the project. On the contrary, it highlights valuable areas for further refinement in PCB design and noise mitigation. The experience reinforces the importance of layout considerations and serves as a stepping stone for future enhancements.

Overall, the project showcases a comprehensive and reproducible analog design flow—from concept to hardware—using modern, open-source tools and platforms.
