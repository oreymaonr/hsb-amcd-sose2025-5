# Introduction

Second order filters (or	biquard	filters) are important since	they are	the	building blocks in the construction of $N^{th}$ order	filters, for $N > 2$. When $N$ is odd the $N^{th}$ order filter can be realised using $\frac{N-1}{2}$ second order filters and one first order filters. When  $N$ is even, we need $N-1$ second order filters. 

Second order filters can be used to construct four different types of filters. The transfer function of four different filters is shown in [table 1](#table-1--transfer-functions), where $W_0 = 1/RC$ and $H_0$ is the low frequency gain of transfer function. The philtre names are often abbreviated as BPF(Bandpass filter), HPF(Highpass Filter), LPF(Lowpass Filter), BSF(Bandstop Filter).

### Table 1 : Transfer Functions

|Filter Type |Transfer Function |
|------------|------------|
|Low Pass Filter | $\frac{V_{03}}{V_i} = \frac{H_0}{(1+\frac{s}{w_0 Q}+\frac{s^2}{w_0^2})}$|
|High Pass Filter | $\frac{V_{01}}{V_i} = \frac{H_0\frac{s^2}{w_0^2}}{(1+\frac{s}{w_0 Q}+\frac{s^2}{w_0^2})}$|
|Band Pass Filter | $\frac{V_{02}}{V_i} = \frac{-H_0\frac{s}{w_0}}{(1+\frac{s}{w_0 Q}+\frac{s^2}{w_0^2})}$|
|Band Stop Filter | $\frac{V_{04}}{V_i} = \frac{(1 + \frac{s^2}{w_0^2})H_0}{(1+\frac{s}{w_0 Q}+\frac{s^2}{w_0^2})}$|

# **BASICS OF FILTER DESIGN**
## **1.1 THE FILTER APPROXIMATION** 

In filter design, the goal is to distinguish between useful signal components and unwanted noise or interference. Ideally, a filter would pass all desired frequencies without distortion while completely rejecting undesired frequencies. However, this ideal filter response is not physically realizable due to practical limitations inherent in real-world systems.
The **filter approximation problem** arises from the need to design filters that approximate the ideal behaviour as closely as possible while adhering to physical and technological constraints. The design process involves selecting an appropriate approximation function and filter structure to meet given specifications for magnitude and phase response, roll-off characteristics, and allowable ripple.

### **1.1.1 Ideal Filter**

An ideal filter is a theoretical construct characterized by:  
•	Brick-wall characteristic: A perfectly sharp transition from passband to stopband at the cutoff frequency.
•	Flat magnitude response in the passband: Constant gain for all frequencies below the cutoff frequency.
•	Infinite attenuation in the stopband: Total rejection of all frequencies above the cutoff frequency.

### **1.1.2 Practical Filter**

A practical filter is the realizable implementation of a filter that approximates the ideal filter characteristics as closely as possible. Its behaviour is limited by physical component tolerances and achievable performance:              
•	Ripple in the passband and/or stopband: Small variations in gain rather than perfectly flat response.                  
•	Finite attenuation in the stopband: Incomplete suppression of unwanted frequencies.                          
•	Gradual roll-off: The transition from passband to stopband occurs over a finite frequency range.

## **1.2 FILTER TEMPLATE**

In practical filter design, it is impossible to implement an ideal filter with an infinitely sharp transition between passband and stopband, zero ripple, and infinite attenuation. Therefore, a filter template establishes performance limits that approximate the ideal response within tolerable deviations.
By setting precise boundaries for key parameters—such as passband gain, stopband attenuation, and the width of the transition band—a filter template ensures that the resulting design will meet both functional and implementation requirements.
A typical filter template specifies the following parameters, which apply to all filter types (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandstop):

**Passband specifications**: The template defines an acceptable range of gain variation within the passband, commonly referred to as passband ripple. This is quantified by upper and lower limits, ensuring that the gain remains within a specified range, such as ±1 dB, across all frequencies in the passband. Additionally, the passband edge frequency, denoted specifies the upper or lower frequency limit of the passband.

**Stopband specifications**: The filter template also sets requirements for attenuation in the stopband. The stopband edge frequency defines the frequency beyond which the filter must provide significant attenuation to unwanted signals. A minimum attenuation level, typically expressed in decibels (dB), specifies how much unwanted signals must be suppressed to ensure sufficient signal separation.

**Transition band**: Between the passband and stopband lies the transition band, a frequency range over which the filter's response transitions from low attenuation to high attenuation. The width of the transition band is a critical parameter because it directly impacts filter complexity. A narrower transition band generally requires a higher-order filter, resulting in increased circuit complexity, sensitivity to component variations, and potential implementation challenges. Conversely, a wider transition band allows for a lower-order filter, simplifying design but reducing selectivity.

By defining these parameters, the filter template sets clear and achievable targets for filter designers. Once the template is established, it serves as the reference for selecting an appropriate filter approximation method (e.g., Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic), which provides a realizable filter that meets the template’s requirements.

## **2. BIQUADS**
A biquad is a filter section that implements a second-order transfer function, meaning its transfer function has a quadratic denominator (hence the name "biquad"). It is a fundamental building block used to design higher-order filters by cascading several second-order sections.
A typical biquad transfer function is of the form:

$H(s) = \frac{(b_0 s^2+b_1 s+b_2)}{(a_0 s^2+a_1 s+a_2)}$

### **TYPES OF BIQUAD CIRCUITS**
**Sallen Key Biquad**

The Sallen-Key biquad is one of the simplest and most widely used second-order filter topologies. It typically requires only a single operational amplifier along with passive components (resistors and capacitors). This circuit is well-suited for realizing filters where the design requires poles only (no zeros), such as lowpass and highpass filters. It is particularly attractive due to its low component count and straightforward design procedure. However, the Sallen-Key configuration suffers from sensitivity issues: its performance degrades as the quality factor (Q) increases because it becomes more sensitive to component variations, particularly for high-Q applications. It is best used for filters with modest Q values where component tolerances can be well controlled.

**Tow Thomas Biquad**
The Tow-Thomas biquad is a widely used second-order active filter circuit valued for its versatility and efficiency. It can realize a variety of filter responses—including lowpass, bandpass, and highpass—using only three operational amplifiers along with resistors and capacitors. The circuit’s structure is based on a cascade of two integrators followed by a summing amplifier, which together form a robust architecture for implementing second-order systems. This configuration allows designers to achieve a general biquadratic transfer function with arbitrary poles and zeros, providing independent control over key filter parameters such as natural frequency and quality factor (Q). The Tow-Thomas topology is particularly well-suited for applications requiring precise filter characteristics, making it a popular choice in both analog signal processing and active filter design.



**KHN Biquad**

The KHN biquad, named after Kerwin, Huelsman, and Newcomb, is a versatile second-order active filter topology that allows simultaneous realization of multiple filter responses from a single circuit structure. It typically uses three operational amplifiers and provides lowpass, bandpass, and highpass outputs concurrently from the same input signal. This makes it especially useful in applications where multiple filter characteristics are required.

The general structure of the KHN biquad is derived from a canonical second-order block diagram, implemented with two integrators and a summing amplifier. It is characterized by good sensitivity properties and allows independent tuning of natural frequency, w and quality factor (Q), providing flexibility and precision in filter design.

The general transfer function for the KHN biquad is:

$H(s) = \frac{(b_0 s^2+b_1 s+b_2)}{(1+\frac{s}{w_0 Q}+\frac{s^2}{w_0^2})}$







# **TYPES OF FILTERS**
## **Lowpass Filter**
A low pass filter allows low-frequency signals (frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency ${f_c}$ ) to pass through with minimal attenuation while progressively attenuating signals at higher frequencies. An ideal LPF would have a perfectly flat response up to ${f_c}$ and then an immediate transition to complete attenuation (a brick-wall cutoff). In reality, a practical LPF exhibits a gradual roll-off beyond ${f_c}$, with the steepness of this roll-off determined by the order of the filter (e.g., -20 dB/decade for first-order, -40 dB/decade for second-order). Practical LPFs may also introduce slight ripple in the passband or stopband depending on the design type.

## **Highpass Filter**
A high pass filter does the opposite of a low pass filter: it allows frequencies above a specified cutoff frequency to pass while attenuating frequencies below it. An ideal HPF would perfectly block all frequencies below ${f_c}$ and allow all above it with no loss. A practical HPF, however, exhibits a gradual roll-off near ${f_c}$ and may show slight peaking or ripple depending on its order and approximation.

## **Bandpass Filter**
A band pass filter allows signals within a certain frequency range, centered around a resonant or center frequency ${f_0}$, to pass, while attenuating signals below and above this range. An ideal BPF would have perfectly flat gain inside the passband and sharp transitions at the band edges. A practical BPF shows a gradual roll-off and a passband width determined by the quality factor 𝑄, which controls the filter’s selectivity: a higher Q gives a narrower passband with sharper transitions, while a lower Q produces a broader passband.

## **Bandstop Filter**
A band stop filter, also called a notch filter when the stopband is very narrow, attenuates a specific band of frequencies around a center frequency ${f_0}$ and allows frequencies outside this range to pass. An ideal BSF would completely eliminate frequencies within the stopband and perfectly pass all others. A practical BSF has finite attenuation in the stopband and gradual transitions at the band edges.
